# Moving Cube
You simply try to get as many coins as possible while avoiding the incoming objects.

The Main class is Move, run the application from that class. If error given when running, create a new project in ide(eclipse) and simply copy all of the .java files(MOVE,SCORE,POINT,CUBE,PLAYER) onto the new project's respective src folder and save it. Then hit run. When you run the application an applet should appear, click on the applet(the black area) then use your keypad arrows (UP, DOWN , LEFT, RIGHT) to navigate the cube. Enjoy.
